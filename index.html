    <h1><font size ='+5'><B>Deborah Boyle</B></font></h1>
    <ol>
    <li><h4 style="padding-top: 50px;">Do you consent to giving your input on this survey?</h4></li>
    <p style="font-family:courier new;">Yes</p>
    
    <li><h4>Do you have an experienced issue with the the NHS? If so, what was it?</h4></li>
    <b style="font-family:Courier New;">Working in it (worked in it for 30 years)</b>
    <ul style="font-family:courier new;">
      <li>How do you sum up 30 years of work?</li>
      <li>Budgetary constrictments - Strong belief in the public health service, people should be able to access quality healthcare </li>
      <li>Mismatch between healthcare wanted and healthcare given</li>
      <li>Effectively we have rationing </li>
      <li>Quality of life issues fall behind when there are budget constraints</li>
      <li>Impact harder to measure</li>
    </ul>
    <b style="font-family:Courier New;">Being a patient in it</b>
    <ul style="font-family:courier new;">
    <li>Multiple episodes of being a patient in it</li>
    <li>Not representive as a member of staff - come sometimes shortcut systems - systems in a way non-senior staff might not be able to </li>
    </ul>

    <li><h4>How do you feel about waiting times at hospitals? </h4></li>
    <ul style="font-family:courier new;">
      <li>Much longer than we would like </li>
      <li>Backlog of operating, ability to see patients for appointments, meet patient desires and expectations and requirements</li>
      </ul> 

    <li><h4>Are hospital staff overworked? Why/why not?</h4></li>
    <ul style="font-family:courier new;">
      <li>Yes, of course they are
      <li>Understaffed - people come in who are often not fit to work because they don't want to let anyone down (patients and staff alike)</li>
      <li>Poor managerial economies of scale </li>
      <li>Managers have different motives than clinicians - managers are saving money while clinicians want to deliver the absolute best care </li>
      <li>Different but equal pressures for members of staff in term of clinic</li>
      </ul>

    <li><h4>Would a wearable device that monitors health be invasive? Why/ why not</h4></li>
    <ul style="font-family:courier new;">
      <li>Hard to imagine that the device could be so specific and sensitive </li>
      <li>Depends what you mean by invasive </li>
      <li>In a medical sense it means it penetrates your skin </li>
      <li>Pill cam - virtual colonoscopy, swallow a pill cam that works its way through you taking photos of your gastrointestinal tract</li>
      </ul> 
 
    <li><h4>What's your opinion on your health data being sent to the NHS?</h4></li>
    <ul style="font-family:courier new;">
      <li>a good example of data monitoring and data devices are devices that keep an eye on your blood sugar and they connect via an app </li>
      <li>mixed feelings about it </li>
      <li>its such a massive organisation </li>
      <li>still issues about people sharing their data because of issues around data security/ not trusting it because of the potential for the misuse of it </li>
      <li>e.g. a woman applying for a mortgage and disclosed she was pregnant and mortgage was pulled - see news article </li>
      <li>I'm not sure it should </li>
      <li>Not sure any company should have such large amounts of personal data - what purpose would it serve</li>
    </ul>

    <li><h4>What is your overall opinion on the NHS? Why is this?</h4></li></ol>
    <p style="font-family:courier new; padding-left: 65px;">I am a huge champion of the NHS and its providing a very invaluable service. Biggest issue is people are trying to run it like a business but is really difficult to quantify so many elements of it. E.g. women's healthcare - quality of life and the impact of addressing it is really hard to measure.  And the same with healthcare for elderly persons â€“ hard to measure the impact of that. </p>
